# Bike Share Data Exploration

This project is a 'check-on'learning' from the Python portion of Udacity's
Data Analyst Nanodegree program. This python program queries three different
CSV files which contain about 300,000 entries and have been wrangled. The only
complication is that one CSV did not contain user data contained in the other
two documents.

Objectives:
  - Provide the user with an intuitive terminal program that is nicely formatted
  - Make navigating through the looping mechanisms easy
  - Always provide a way to exit the program to the user
  - Display time query data
  - Ensure that all available commands do not generate errors
  - Navigate between data sets missing categories without causing a program reboot

### Points for Improvement

I found myself using the global reserved word which makes me think that I could
have orchestrated a slightly better program design.

### Dependencies

This depends on Numpy and Pandas. I will attempt to do a pip freeze and bundle
it with this project (although these are pretty generic packages)

### Future Uses

I hope to visit this again as part of the Deep Learning materials that I'm
currently taking.
